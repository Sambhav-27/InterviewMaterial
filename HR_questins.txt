- First of all, thank you sir for the opportunity to introduce myself.
My name is sambhav and i am from Delhi. I'm pursuing computer engineering, till now my percentage is __. I belong to a middle class family of 5 members.
Talking about my technical skills, I can say I'm a decent enough programmer with good problem solving skills.
As i have mentioned in my resume, I prefer c++ for coding.

As far as my inspiaration is considered, it is from my parents who helps and motivates and encourages me in a hundred little ways everyday.

My hobbies, I play outdoor sports as a recreational activity.During my school days, i've won a gold medal in badminton at district level. I'm also good at basketball and cricket.


During this summer, I developed a Recommender system based website and also an algorithm for a spam classifier.
also during the earlier part of this year i built a train reservation system. The main focus here was on applying database concepts.
That's all about me. Thank you.
---------------------------
- strength: well! some people are born talented, some have to work hard for each and every little thing. I'm the second one. So I can safely say, i am not afraid of hard work.
I'm a self motivated person.
weaknesses: I can say I'm a easily deceived person, I trust everyone.

- Why didn't you interned:Sir I tried for 5 companies in the 5th semester, I didn't get selected. In the 6th sem i didn't apply for a single company beacause I thought of improving my skills by doing projects myself. In this way i would be improving at a self pace.

- Why should we hire you over others: Sir I don't know about others but i can say about myself. You have very well tested my problem solving skills, so you must be having a fair idea about my skills.
Other than that i can say that I'm a calm person and believe me i have learnt a lot in the past year about handling failure and being commposed.

- why do you want to work with us: 

- challenges in project: well! the whole project was new to me. For the first 15 days i had to learn about machine learning and then a lil bit Django as well.
First i has to search a lot for a good enough dataset.

 Calculating accuracy was a problem to me, i couldn't find a way to test the efficiency of my algo, I asked and discussed with many of my friends. As there were holidays i couldn't find any teacher in college. finally I solved it by myself by calculating MAE.
The matrix for the user-movie was not full. Not all users rate all the movies, So had to track the transactions dataset.


- improvement: cold start problem, track user clicks, conten+collaborative

- toughest question you have solved: Not the toughest but it was a good question, ADMAG.
